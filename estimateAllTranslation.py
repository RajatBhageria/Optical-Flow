  File clarification:
    Estimate the translation for all features for each bounding box as well as its four corners
    - Input startXs: all x coordinates for features wrt the first frame
    - Input startYs: all y coordinates for features wrt the first frame
    - Input img1: the first image frame
    - Input img2: the second image frame
    - Output newXs: all x coordinates for features wrt the second frame
    - Output newYs: all y coordinates for features wrt the second frame
